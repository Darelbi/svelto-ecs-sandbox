Svelto ECS tutorial

--------

This project wants to be a small game using Svelto ECS for learning purposes and as tutorial, it uses 
Unity 2017.2.0f3 (64-bit) and Visual Studio Community 2017.

All the dependencies are included in the project, so it will compile out of the box

--------

For the sake of knowledge these are the current dependencies:


* [Kore.Utiles](https://github.com/Darelbi/Kore.Utils)
* [Svelto.Commons](https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto.Common)
* [Svelto.ECS](https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto.ECS)

Personal note, since I use often throw-away strong passwords, I keep this memo on how to allow SourceTree asking me again

remove passwd file from:
